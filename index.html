        A group of space demons has discovered the codes to the transporters on
        the moon substation your astronaut team maintains. You have 5 minutes to
        destroy all incoming dmons before new transporter codes can be
        configured. Can you get all the demons in time before any are fully
        transported and ready to wreak havoc? We know you can! Game Logic
        Players must click directly on each space demon with their mouse as it
        appears before it grows big enough to be fully transported. If that
        happens, the game will be over. Players win by destroying all space
        demons within the 5-minute deadline. A timer on the screen shows the
        time remaining to get the job done. Then the player may click on the
        "Play Again" button to give it another try.
