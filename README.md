# Transporter Demons

## Description

A group of space demons has discovered the codes to the transporters on the moon substation your astronaut team maintains. You have 5 minutes to destroy all incoming dmons before new transporter codes can be configured. Can you get all the demons in time before any are fully transported and ready to wreak havoc? We know you can!


## Deplyment

The web game is deployed at (TBA).


Game Logic

Players         must click directly on each space demon with their mouse as it appears before it grows big enough to be fully transported. If that happens, the game will be over. Players win by destroying all space demons within the 5-minute deadline. A timer on the screen shows the time remaining to get the job done. Then the player may click on the "Play Again" button to give it another try.


# Post-MVP Plans

- Add a point sstem with results that are persisted.
- Add points for varying levels of demon appearance before it is destroyed.
- Make different difficulty levels.
- Make it multi-player with both sides, space demon and astronaut, being able to play against each other.
